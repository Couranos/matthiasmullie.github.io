I'm a senior software engineer with an appetite for complex problems. I'm easy
going & take responsibility for my work. Most of my expertise is with PHP,
Python, MySQL, JavaScript & related tech, but I'll fiddle with anything when I
get the chance.

I rolled into software development when online gaming was more fun than
homework: I built a hack for the game and ended up spending more time on that,
than actually playing the game. I'm sorry for ruining the game!

My first programming job landed me in a terrific team of both software engineers
and designers. Every single one of them, like me, very passionate about making
the internet a better place. We open-sourced our CMS software as
[Fork CMS](http://www.fork-cms.com/), a project I eventually ended up leading.
Good times!

Being all excited about open-source, but craving an technical challenge,
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) bacame my next adventure. And boy, was I
not disappointed to work with world-class colleagues on this top-tier website!
An application of this size & traffic sure it something else.

I care about code architecture. I love hard challenges, clean code & learning
new things. Bonus points for open source projects. I play soccer & like to
travel. I hate writing things like this about myself :)
