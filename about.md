title: About

I’m a software engineer with a passion for web development.
While I’m generally interested in technology as a whole and have occasionally fiddled with a broad variety of programming languages, my expertise lies in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and related technologies.

I had always been quite interested in using technology throughout my childhood, but only started getting into creating technology when playing America's Army, an online multiplayer shooter.
I got lured into the cheating scene and over time racked up a considerable amount of hours working on my own C++ hack.
I ended up developing that hack more than I actually played.
I’m sorry for ruining the game!

My first serious programming gig landed me in quite a terrific team of both software engineers and designers.
Every single one of them, like me, very passionate about making the internet a better place.
Sweating the details.
The combined enthusiasm and knowledge was contagious, as we happily started taking on high-profile clients.
We open-sourced our CMS software as [Fork CMS](http://www.fork-cms.com/), a project I eventually ended up leading.
Good times!

A quest for an extra-ordinary technical challenge ultimately sparked my interest in Wikipedia, coincidentally also built atop open source software: [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/).
Working with world-class colleagues on a top-tier website in an incredible environment (yay American culture!) – does it get any better?
